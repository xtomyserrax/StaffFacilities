# StaffFacilities
The most advanced staff management plugin ever!

This page is meant to be a wiki so you can find out everything you need to know about the plugin! Of course you can always ask for support to me on discord, but here on the wiki page I wish I could have explained in my best way how all features work and how you can configure them!
